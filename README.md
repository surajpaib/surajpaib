### A bit more about me
Born to a family of doctors, I was the black sheep, tinkering with computers and ever fascinated by technology. But when you grow up in a household where medical jargon dominates conversations, a certain sentiment toward it develops. I developed a passion to work with health and medical technology. I find it very satisfying to help add value and technology to betterment of healthcare and enabling systems to play my part in helping the society.
