## Hello!

I am currently a research scholar at the AIM Lab and a PhD candidate at Maastricht University. I work primarily with medical imaging, applying quantitative deep learning methods to improve clinical practice. Before starting my PhD, I graduated with a Msc in Artificial Intelligence at the Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering in Maastricht where my focus was on Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Advanced Machine Learning. During this time, I also worked extensively in Deep Learning research for improvement of various pipelines in radiotherapy.
