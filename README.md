## Hello!

I am currently a student researcher at Maastro Clinic working on medical imaging, applying quantitative deep learning methods in the field of radiology and radiotherapy. I am pursuing my Msc in Artificial Intelligence at the Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering in Maastricht where my focus is on Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Advanced Machine Learning.
